All data taken from UCI HAR Dataset (Anguita et al [1])

All variables covered result from Step 5 of run_analysis.R script (which is included in submission of this project). 

The full description of the original data as described below *in italics* is from the "features_info.txt" from the UCI HAR Dataset (Anguita et al [1])

*The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.*

*Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).*

*Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).*

*These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:*
*'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.*

*tBodyAcc-XYZ*
*tGravityAcc-XYZ*
*tBodyAccJerk-XYZ*
*tBodyGyro-XYZ*
*tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ*
*tBodyAccMag*
*tGravityAccMag*
*tBodyAccJerkMag*
*tBodyGyroMag*
*tBodyGyroJerkMag*
*fBodyAcc-XYZ*
*fBodyAccJerk-XYZ*
*fBodyGyro-XYZ*
*fBodyAccMag*
*fBodyAccJerkMag*
*fBodyGyroMag*
*fBodyGyroJerkMag*

*The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:*

*mean(): Mean value*
*std(): Standard deviation*
*mad(): Median absolute deviation*
*max(): Largest value in array*
*min(): Smallest value in array*
*sma(): Signal magnitude area*
*energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.*
*iqr(): Interquartile range*
*entropy(): Signal entropy*
*arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4*
*correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals*
*maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude*
*meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency*
*skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal* 
*kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal*
*bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.*
*angle(): Angle between to vectors.*

*Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:*

*gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean*

For our purposes we have made two major changes to the data as presented in the original dataset:
* Removed all variables apart from those that summarize the data by taking the mean or standard deviation
* Relabelled all remaining variables with more detailed descriptions

In total we have the following signals, categorized:
* Time signal
  - By instrument (accelerometer or gyroscope)
    - Accelerometer signal further divided into body ( and gravity accelerometer
    - Accelerometer linear acceleration and angular velocity calculated to form "Jerk" signals
  - By axis (x,y or z)
  - By magnitude
  
* Frequency signal
  - By instrument (body or gyroscope)
    - No body/gravity division in accelerometer
    - Jerk signals calculated
  - By axis (x,y or z)
  - By magnitude
  
* Angle variables

It is important to note that all variables have already been standardized and hence fall within a range of [-1,1]. 

The systematic changes made to the labels are listed below (this can also be found in the ReadMe.md file uploaded, step 4):
* Removed all punctuation such as "(",")",",","-"
* All text to lower case
* Prefix "t" replaced with "timedomain"
* Prefix "f" replaced with "frequencydomain"
* "acc" replaced with "accelerometer"
* "mag" replaced with "magnitude"
* "gyro" replaced with "gyroscope"
* "jerk" replaced with "linearacceleration" if preceded by "accelerometer" or "angularvelocity" if preceded by "gyroscope"
* Column label "y" replaced with "activitylabels"
* Column label "subj" replaced with "subjectlabels"

For example, the variable "tBodyAccMean" is replaced by "timedomainbodyaccelerometermean". This hopefully gives a better idea of the nature of the variable at a quick glance.

All rows are observations summarized by the average of the signals generated by activity first, then by subject; that is to say the first 30 rows of the table consist of the 30 subjects' average signals generated whilst doing the "laying" activity, then the second 30 rows of the table consist of the 30 subjects' average signals generated whilst doing the "sitting" activity and so forth.
There are 88 columns (the activity label, subject label and 88 variables of summarized signal data) and 180 rows of summarized observation data.
